# Testing Plan - Problem 2
1. Come up with 4 test data sets that were different from the given data set, that I could figure out the answer to by hand.
4. Calculate the answers by hand given the test data.
5. Once the function is written, create print statements that compare the expected output that I calculated, with the actual output of the function.
6. Look at the print statement outputs and see if there are any issues.
7. Adjust code as necessary.


|Test|Expected Output|Actual Output|
|---------|:----|:----|
|**Test Data 1**|
|Positive Predictive Output|0.5|0.5|
|Negative Predictive Output|0.5|0.5|
|**Test Data 2**|
|Positive Predictive Output|1|1.0|
|Negative Predictive Output|1|1.0|
|**Test Data 3**|
|Positive Predictive Output|0|0.0|
|Negative Predictive Output|0|0.0|
|**Test Data 4**|
|Positive Predictive Output|0.75|0.75|
|Negative Predictive Output|0.5|0.5|
