Assignment 3 Readme
The "starter code" is provided in a python file

assignment3_problem1.py

Gives you starter code functions to obtain the mean and standard deviation of a population. Your task is to calculate the z-score for each item in the list provided.

Do not alter the starter functions or define any new ones. Do not call any library methods. You may use arithmetic operators.

The z-score function is named but you will need to complete it by writing the necessary parameters, the code within the function, and the return statement. You should also write the docstring.

Finally, call the functions with the necessary arguments and compare the results with your expected output.
