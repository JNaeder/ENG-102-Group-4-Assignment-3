# Testing Plan - Problem 1
1. Come up with 4 random test data sets that were different from the given data set.
2. Use the starter functions to find the mean and standard deviation of each data set.
3. Plug the mean and standard deviation into a z-score calculator from the internet.
4. Find the z-score of the mean, greatest, and least for each data set.
5. Once the function is written, create print statements that compare the expected output that I found with the online calculator, with the actual output of the function.
6. Look at the print statement outputs and see if there are any issues.
7. Adjust code as necessary.

|Test|Expected Output|Actual Output|
|---------|:----|:----|
|**Test Data 1**|
|Mean|0.0|0.0|
|Greatest|1.0|1.0|
|Least|-1.0|-1.0|
|**Test Data 2**|
|Mean|0.0|0.0|
|Greatest|1.79|1.79|
|Least|-1.39|-1.39|
|**Test Data 3**|
|Mean|0.0|0.0|
|Greatest|1.37|1.37|
|Least|-1.57|-1.57|
|**Test Data 4**|
|Mean|0.0|0.0|
|Greatest|1.65|1.65|
|Least|-1.65|-1.65|
